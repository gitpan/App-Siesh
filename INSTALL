Installation instructions for App::Siesh

To install this module, just do:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install  (this step may need to be done as the superuser)

Testing App::Siesh

To run the test suite, please create a config file named t/siesh.conf. See
the pod of bin/siesh for possible values.

	host = imap
	user = dom
	password = xxx

If this file does not exist, we just skip all tests that need a network
connection. We also won't delete any files during testing on your
account. But as we need to test some destructive cases, we can't test
with a non empty account. So please delete all your scripts before you
run any author tests, otherwise we just bail out.
