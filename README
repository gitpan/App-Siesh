NAME
    siesh - Sieve Shell

SYNOPSIS
    siesh --user USER --host SERVER

DESCRIPTION
    Siesh provides a shell-like interface for manipulating sieve scripts
    using the ManageSieve protocol.

OPTIONS
    --user|-u USERNAME
        Specifies the username to use when logging into the sieve server.
        This option defaults to the value of the environment variable
        "USER".

    --host||-h HOST
        Specifies the machine to connect to. Defaults to "imap".

CONFIGURATION FILE
    When siesh is invoked, it first reads configurations variables from
    /etc/siesh.conf or ~/.siesh.conf if one of these files exist. The file
    is structured as a set of lines with name and values seperated by a
    equal signs.

            user = mario
            host = sieve.example.com

    Currently only these both variables are recognized. Values are overriden
    by the configurations options specified on the command line.

COMMANDS
    list
        Prints a list of all scripts on the server. The currently active
        script, if any, is marked by a *** (astersik).

        Synonyms: ls

    delete *script-name* *...*
        Deletes a script. It's not possible to delete a active script, so
        please use deactivate first. There's no way to undelete this
        message.

        Synonyms: rm

    edit *script-name*
        Edits a script on the server without downloading it explicitly to
        your disk first. Under the hood it creates a temporary file, put the
        script content in it and calls $ENV{EDITOR} on it. After that the
        script is uploaded back. It's also possible to create and edit a new
        script with this command.

        If your script is syntactical incorrect, you will be prompted to
        re-edit the file or throw away your changes.

    activate *script-name*
        Activates the listed script. User may have multiple Sieve scripts on
        the server, yet only one script may be used for filtering of
        incoming messages. This is the active script. Users may have zero or
        one active scripts

    deactivate
        Deactivate all scripts. Deactivation of all your scripts results in
        no filtering at all.

    cat *script-name* *...*
        Print scripts on the standard output.

    quit
        Terminates the sessiion with the remote SIEVE server. An end of file
        will also terminate the session and exit.

    help
        Print a short description of all commands.

    put *file-name* *script-name*
        Store a local file as script on the remote machine.

    get *file-name* *local-name*
        Retrieve a remote script and store it on the local machine.
